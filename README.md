Just me implementing a simple router for a fun way to learn the language.

Things I want to implement.

- [ ] Routing with dynamic parameters (e.g. `/users/:id`)
- [ ] A way of having sessions in the router (https://pkg.go.dev/context or https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Request.Context, but have to read more about them.)
